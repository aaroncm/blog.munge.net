My annual *(note: not actually annual)* non-definitive list of albums I liked
from the last year. 

*   Amanda Palmer, *Amanda Palmer Performs the Popular Hits of Radiohead on Her
    Magical Ukelele*. This shouldn't work as anything but a stunt, but it
    actually does.
*   Arcade Fire, *The Suburbs.* The album I'd hoped *Neon Bible* would be.
*   The Books, *The Way Out*. This group may be the canonical example of
    how I love [things](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pysC3hNAhE) that
    almost nobody else I know would like, but those people are missing out.
*   Caravan Palace, *Dragons*. French electro-jazz that sounds like Benoît
    Charest crossed with Daft Punk.
*   Cee-Lo Green, *The Lady Killer*. "Fuck You" got all the attention, but
    the rest of the album is just as good. Gnarls Barkley is great, but
    I really prefer his solo work (see also *...Is the Soul Machine)*.
*   Childish Gambino, *I am Just a Rapper, I am Just a Rapper 2, Culdesac*. The
    rap alias of actor Donald Glover, and legitimately great work.
*   Das Racist, *Sit Down, Man*. It's a shame that most people will only ever
    know them for the novelty/parody "Combination Pizza Hut & Taco Bell". Those
    people are missing out on some of the cleverest rap around. Not recommended
    for people who take music too seriously, or those who insist that music not
    be taken seriously.
*   Girl Talk, *All Day*. He's getting better; this album sounds more like
    a composition than his previous effort's (brilliant) stunt.
*   Janelle Monáe, *The ArchAndroid*. Like a lot of people, I found out about
    her thanks to her brilliant
    [Letterman performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMyc148Do_Q). James
    Brown meets Sun Ra meets Prince meets Philip Dick.
*   Mumford & Sons, *Sigh No More*. Describing this as folk-rock feels like it
    would give the wrong impression. Go listen to
    ["The Cave"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KkUeRPjc-Y).
*   Run On Sentence, *You The Darkness & Me*. An old friend of mine from
    college; I had no idea he would turn out to be an
    [amazingly talented musician](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVKKkYfBuYQ).
    There are too many bands that deserve so much more success and recognition
    than they've had, and this is one of them.
*   Sage Francis, *Li(f)e*. The whole album is solid, but please please please
    take a listen to the stunning Yann-Tiersen-backed
    ["The Best of Times"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA8hzUDXvtk).
*   Sufjan Stevens, *The Age of Adz*. Well, that got weird quick, didn't it?
    Needs an editor badly, but mostly quite good.
*   The Weakerthans, *Live at the Burton Cummings Theatre*. Possibly my
    favorite band, in their hometown, doing a perfect set.
